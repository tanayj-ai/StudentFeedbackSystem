# üìö Student Feedback System (OOPL Mini Project)

## Project Overview

This project implements a **secure, role-based desktop application** designed for the **Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory (Semester - III)** Mini Project. It digitizes the process of collecting, storing, and analyzing student feedback on courses, faculty, and facilities.

The system replaces inefficient manual methods by ensuring **anonymity** and providing **real-time statistical reports** to support administrative decision-making.

## ‚ú® Key System Features

* **Role-Based Access Control:** Provides secure login for **Student, Faculty, and Admin** user roles.
* **Dynamic Forms:** Feedback forms are **customizable per course** or department. The GUI dynamically loads relevant questions based on the course selected.
* **Data Confidentiality:** Ensures **confidentiality and anonymity** of all student responses (Objective 2).
* **Automated Reporting:** Generates **consolidated reports** with calculated **course average ratings** and overall **rating distributions** for quality analysis.
* **Database Management:** Admin controls are available for maintenance tasks, including **clearing all feedback data**.
